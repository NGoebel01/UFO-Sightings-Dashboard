This project showcases Python data cleaning with Tableau visualizations. The overall goals were to create a density map of UFO sightings in the United States, determine when sightings occurred most often, and which states have the most sightings report. Data was filtered down to just those that occurred in the US to create both bar charts and again to map only sightings that occurred in the contiguous US. This decision was made to reduce the amount of negative space and because AK and HI didn't contribute many sightings to the data. 

In the dashboard, you can filter by year to see changes in density and which states report the most sightings each year. The results seem to just show a population density map as most sightings each year are in the most populated areas (which is expected because more people will inevitably result in more reports).
